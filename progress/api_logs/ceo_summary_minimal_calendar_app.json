Overview\nA lightweight, installable calendar PWA that runs on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, with one unified TypeScript codebase and minimal binary sizes.\n\n## 2. Objectives\n- Provide intuitive month/week/day views with fast rendering.\n- Enable CRUD operations for single, all-day, and recurring events.\n- Support offline usage, local reminders, and optional ICS import/export.\n- Leverage widely adopted, well-documented libraries and frameworks.\n\n## 3. Target Platforms\n- **Web/PWA:** Any modern browser on Windows 10+, macOS Catalina+, Android 8+, iOS 13+.\n- **Desktop:** Native wrappers via Tauri for Windows/macOS.\n- **Mobile:** Capacitor shell (Android/iOS) or PWA home-screen install.\n\n## 4. Functional Requirements\n1. **Views**\n   - **Month Grid:** Highlight current day, navigate months.\n   - **Week List:** Time slots 00:00\u201323:59 with events.\n   - **Day Detail:** Chronological event list.\n2. **Event CRUD**\n   - Title, start/end time, description.\n   - All-day and multi-day events.\n   - Edit/delete with confirmation.\n3. **Reminders**\n   - Customizable offsets per event.\n   - Local notifications via Notifications API.\n4. **Recurring Events**\n   - Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly rules.\n   - Exceptions support.\n5. **ICS Import/Export**\n   - Read/write `.ics` files using the popular `ics` library.\n\n## 5. Non-Functional Requirements\n- **Performance:** Monthly view renders in under 500\u00a0ms on mid-range devices.\n- **Offline Resilience:** Cache UI + data, queue reminders locally.\n- **Bundle Size:** Web bundle <\u00a0100\u00a0KB gzipped.\n- **Accessibility:** WCAG\u00a02.1\u00a0AA compliance.\n- **Localization:** Support common locales; configure date formats.\n\n## 6. Recommended Technology Stack\n- **Language:** TypeScript (static types, rich tooling, zero runtime cost).\n- **UI Framework:**\n  - **Primary:** React\u00a0+\u00a0TypeScript w/ Vite.\n  - **Alternative:** SvelteKit\u00a0+\u00a0TypeScript.\n- **Bundler:** Vite.\n- **Desktop Packaging:** Tauri.\n- **Mobile Packaging:** Capacitor or PWA.\n- **Storage:** IndexedDB via `localForage` or SQLite.\n- **Date Utilities:** `date-fns` or `Luxon`.\n- **Recurrence Rules:** `rrule.js`.\n- **ICS Handling:** `ics` npm package.\n- **Notifications & Offline:** Service Worker, Notifications API, Background Sync.\n\n## 7. Architecture Overview\n- **Front End:** Single SPA codebase (React/SvelteKit).\n- **Data Layer:** Abstraction over IndexedDB/SQLite.\n- **Notification Service:** Native integration via Capacitor or browser APIs.\n- **Packaging:** Tauri/Capacitor shells.\n\n## 8. UI/UX Guidelines\n- Responsive layout.\n- Follow system theme (light/dark mode).\n- Platform\u2011native navigation patterns.\n\n## 9. Milestones\n1. Core SPA with month/week/day views and local TypeScript setup.\n2. Event CRUD + local storage + service worker caching.\n3. Notifications integration and reminder scheduling.\n4. Recurrence support via rrule.js and exception handling.\n5. ICS import/export using `ics` library.\n6. Desktop builds with Tauri; mobile shells with Capacitor.\n7. QA: performance benchmarks, accessibility audit, cross\u2011platform testing.\n```\nProgress docs:\n```\n# manager_minimal_calendar_app.md\n# Manager Progress for team
